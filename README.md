# JS_OOP_PubSub
Javascript OOP; implement a publisher subscriber model

In this project I will implement the Publisher Subscriber Model for a simple application, wherin the user can add and remove items to and from a list. The list will be shown on the page.


Step 1.
Create the (incomplete) app (HTML, CSS, JS) without using OOP.

Step 2.
Use an object literal for the (unordered) list of names.
